Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Gabriel Family Clinic healthcare platform. Based on my analysis, I can see the key data structures and entities that need to be represented in the database schema:

1.  Locations: Multiple clinic locations (San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley/San Jose)
2.  Doctors/Medical Staff: Various specialists with different specialties
3.  Services: Healthcare services offered (cardiology, primary care, etc.)
4.  Patients: Patient information and records
5.  Testimonials: Patient testimonials with ratings and conditions
6.  Appointments: Appointment booking and scheduling
7.  Reviews: Patient feedback and ratings

From the testimonials data, I can see:

- Various doctors (Dr. Emily Chen, Dr. Raj Kumar, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. James Patterson, Dr. Sarah Williams)
- Different specialties (Rheumatology, Endocrinology, Cardiology, Physical Therapy, Geriatric Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurology)
- Multiple locations
- Patient conditions and treatment dates
- Ratings and verified testimonials

The clinic offers services like:

- Emergency care
- Primary care
- Cardiology
- Preventive care
- Chronic disease management
- Physical therapy
- Geriatric care

From the schema-org data, I can see location schemas for:

- Singapore location
- Orchard location
- Jurong location

Now I'll create a comprehensive database schema SQL script that includes all these elements, plus additional healthcare-specific tables for a complete system.
